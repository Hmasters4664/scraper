In response, the AVA Gallery presents Oh to find an Island, an expression of this longing for an island of respite, through a return to painting and drawing and the reappearance of the human mark. This longing is however haunted by the knowledge of the co-existence of other terrifying realities and the impossibility of escape from external destruction."	info@ava.co.za	AVA Gallery	21 June 2018 to 19 July 2018

The works are characterised by the overall feeling of a summer lethargy, which she uses to enable the sense of ‘dreamy versions of a real place’. What Dreamland seems to suggest is the possibility that a taming of place, plant and species in human leisure spaces has done little to suppress the wildness in human nature. It is in the daydreams of the artist that we are able to entertain this idea."	info@salon91.co.za	www.salon91.co.za	4 July 2018 to 4 August 2018

Language, by definition, aims to articulate and refine meaning; this exhibition seeks to unravel it. By layering and juxtaposing a variety of recognizable and abstract elements, the ensuing visual relationships open a space for ambiguity prompting new interpretations. While from a certain perspective the works may be said to disrupt the viewing experience, a correlating experience is being encouraged through the careful and considered enmeshment of elements such that each work creates an alluring reconsideration of its potential myriad meanings."	info@ava.co.za	AVA Gallery	21 June 2018 to 19 July 2018
